<h3 align="center">A Monster and Minigame created for UPGRADE's Gatcha Game</h3>

**Concept:**

The University of Pennsylvania Game Research and Development Environment (UPGRADE) was putting together a Gatcha Game, where the prizes were all monsters created by club members. Each monster must have its own minigame, and when I joined the club, I had to create a monster and minigame by myself, so I chose something very simple: a monster that was shaped like a ball, with a pachinko-esque minigame. 

So I created a short minigame where the player has to drop the monster down into the correct opening in order to earn coins, but if they get into the wrong one, they lose coins. These coins can later be used to open more boxes and get more monsters, which allows the player to play more minigames.
